Stellar Observation with Pinhole Optics and Drift Stacking

Welcome to the Stellar Observation with Pinhole Optics and Drift Stacking project! This initiative explores a novel approach to astronomical observation, aiming to simplify the field for enthusiasts and introduce the next generation to the wonders of astronomy and Python programming.

Project Overview
Traditional astronomy relies on large-aperture telescopes—the "bucket method"—to collect light and enhance image resolution. While effective, this technique assumes that the observed brightness of stars directly corresponds to their intrinsic luminosity, overlooking how light collection methods and atmospheric interference can influence perceived brightness.

The project challenges this assumption by:

Utilizing a Pinhole-Sized Primary Optic: Minimizes atmospheric distortion and isolates the divergent nature of specular (mirror-like) targets, such as stars.

Employing Drift Stacking Technique: Uses Earth's natural rotation to scan the sky, capturing uninterrupted trajectories of celestial objects without complex tracking hardware.

By combining these methods, I aim to provide deeper insights into stellar brightness and structure, questioning established norms and making astronomy more accessible.
